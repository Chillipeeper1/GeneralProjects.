## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm **Zabdiel Ríos**, passionate about programming, artificial intelligence, Data science and more.  
My main focus is **Python**, but I love experimenting with new technologies—especially when they involve AI, APIs, Data and Maths.

This repository is my personal playground: a space to test ideas, learn new things, and share what I build along the way.
